  #   - qwen2.5:7b (RECOMMENDED - best tool calling, needs ~5GB RAM)
  #   - qwen2.5:3b (good tool calling, needs ~2GB RAM)
  #   - llama3.2:3b (good balance, needs ~2GB RAM)
  #   - ministral-3:8b (excellent reliable, needs ~5GB RAM)
  # NOTE: qwen2.5:1.5b may fail on complex tool calls with JSON escaping errors
